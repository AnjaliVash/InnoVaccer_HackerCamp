-- Making Lives of Working Staff easier -- 


.  Employee Care:
Each company must create an application over employee care with mainly following navigations:
1.	Upcoming Opportunities/ Events: 
This tab will contain all kinds of opportunities the company is coming up with which can be of two types:
o	Role uplifting: where opportunities that will concern with upliftment of role of employees
o	Fun Time events: It will consist of all the events the club will come up with whether it be team fun of company fun event
o	Knowledge Sharing: Here all events which would guide for better understanding like training, skill sessions, etc. 

2.	Menu and list of prices of food: 
This will have the monthly organised menu available to employees which is free and prized. This is will help them to decide onto what to bring with them and what not to. So that they have planned beforehand for lunch or cafÃ© meet.
It can also include any short time sale of merchandize going on over any celebration season.

3.	Slot selection on when the employee will join work offline: 
Now as we have gone through the corona period, we have realised that itsâ€™ not important for employees to come in full strength. Hence it will be pre-decided on how many seats per team is required and people will have to do the slot booking of a month for their online work so that they can plan on working offline accordingly without any stress.

4.	Hall of Fame:
Itâ€™s always nice to boost your accomplishments and share your happiness with others; hence we must have a hall of fame portal encouraging the employee to work always better in different ways of working; whether it be in field of work or during a fun event; and people cab comment how good they were appreciating their effort.  

5.	Points/gifts and Salary:
Beside fun time most favourite thing is the salary and vouchers won by any employee which should be available in a separate section.
6.	Leaves to apply
This must include how many leaves is one left with and calendar where he/she can plan out his/her outings easily and update manger immediately. ðŸ˜Š

7.	Catch Up Roulette:
Due to the growing technology interaction among peers has decreased which will eventually degrade the human nature in socializing hence this will help them to meet up and stay active in meet employees informally within a company with present staff; only you have to mark yourself available at that time and you will be allotted to meet someone in the office during lunch hour! A great way to socialize, trust and learn things ðŸ˜Š

8.	Error Resolve:
In here there will be two sections created:
o	Resolved: Here we will have the option to enter our experience of facing an error and provide solution to it.  
o	Unresolved: Here you will be adding you problems and simultaneously resolve someone else error while some other employee is solving yours.

9.	Task Status:
Each team has a planned software through which they decide on their task fortnightly or monthly or daily. Which will be shown in this tab so that you are aware of what you are up to today and can update it simultaneously.
